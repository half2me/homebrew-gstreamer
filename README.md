# homebrew-gstreamer
A brew repository for the latest Gstreamer framework and plugins

Sadly, the core repository contains very outdated, missing, or badly written formulas for gstreamer.
I've made this repo to have an always up to date repo for installing the latest gstreamer framework, and all of its plugins.

This is for linux systems only. Use with linuxbrew.
